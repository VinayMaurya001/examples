Advantages of Spring Boot 
Enable building production ready application Quickly
	Embed Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow directly (no need to deploy WAR files)
	Provide opinionated 'starter' dependencies to simplify your build configuration
	Automatically configure Spring and 3rd party libraries whenever possible
	Provide production-ready features such as metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration
	Absolutely no code generation and no requirement for XML configuration

Advantages of Microservices
Software built as microservices can be broken down into multiple component services, 
	so that each of these services can be deployed and then redeployed independently without compromising the integrity of an application. 
	That means that microservice architecture gives developers the freedom to independently develop and deploy services.
Better fault isolation
	if one microservice fails, the others will continue to work.
Code for different services can be written in different languages.
Scalability and reusability, as well as efficiency. 
	Easy to scale and integrate with third-party services.
Components can be spread across multiple servers or even multiple data centers.
Work very well with containers, such as Docker.
Complement cloud activities.
Microservices simplify security monitoring because the various parts of an app are isolated. 
	A security problem could happen in one section without affecting other areas of the project.
Less dependency and easy to test.
Dynamic scaling.
Faster release cycle.
